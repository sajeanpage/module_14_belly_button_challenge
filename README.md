# Module 14 Belly Button Challenge
## Summary

Viewing belly button bacteria data is informative but, visualizing belly button bacteria data gives a perspective of diversity and scale that viewing data can not. In this challenge I built an interactive web page that allows viewers to easily visualizing belly button bacteria data.  
- The site contains:
  - a responsive home page with a drop down menu of test subjects
  - a demographic panel for a selected subject
  - a color coded bar graph of the top 10 bacteria populations for a subject
  - a responsive guage showing wash frequency for a subject
  - a color coded bubble chart of the bacteria populations for a subject
 
- Key technologies include:
  - BootStrap js library
  - D3 js library  
  - Plotly js library
  - Javascript
  - Github Pages
